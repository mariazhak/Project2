Hi! My app is a simulator of product database in store.
A store can keep the information about their products using this app.
It can read information from savings.txt file.

There are two types of products here: product and special.
Special has a discount property.

Available options to do:
1. View all products
2. Add new products
3. Remove products
4. View all specials
5. Change prices
6. View sample product
7. Read info from file (adds file info to existind products)
